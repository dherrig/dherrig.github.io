Hi, I'm David Herrig. Thank you for visiting my site.

In my free time my interests include running, skiing, hiking, backpacking, and
taking road trips to do those things in beautiful new places. I also love
trivia games in many forms, whether a pub quiz, competitive online league, or
shouting answers at the tv while watching Jeopardy.

My work and school experience is primarily in electrical and computer
engineering. Currently I am taking a career break to recharge and pursue new
interests, including working on this site.

Previously I have worked as a hardware design and validation engineer at Google
on ChromeOS & Android tablets and laptops, and before that I worked as a mixed
signal validation engineer at NVIDIA on GPUs, Tegra SOCs, and NVLink & NVSwitch
systems.

## For prospective work opportunities / employers / recruiters

Interested in work together in the future? You can find [my resume here](/resume/).

At this time, I am taking a career break and not actively searching for a job,
but I'm always open to discussing future opportunities.

## About this site

All code for this site is shared on GitHub [here](https://github.com/dherrig/dherrig.github.io/).

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/pages) and was
built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) with the
[Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

## Site Privacy

Visitor traffic to the site is monitored using [Clicky](https://clicky.com), a
privacy-friendly service. I have kept Clicky's default setting for
"full privacy", which means **no personal data is logged**. Basically I can see
stats related to *how many* visitors are on the site, but not *who* they are.
Learn more and see opt-out choices by reading the [Clicky privacy FAQ](https://clicky.com/help/faq/privacy).
