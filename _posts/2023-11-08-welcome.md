Hello and welcome to the first post on my website.

## Why does this site exist

I bought the `davidherrig.com`[^1] domain on a whim some time because owning
the `david@davidherrig.com` email address seemed like a cool idea at the time.

Next, I made a barebones `davidherrig.com` website to give the email address a
tiny bit of credibility. But posting website content felt too much like
work to me - not how I wanted to use my leisure time. So I filled it with some
"under construction" notes and left it to wilt for awhile.

Fast forward to today, I am taking an extended break from work and I have
more time and energy for side projects - like adding content to this website.

## What is the site for

I plan to use this site...

* to post occasionally about interesting side projects I'm working on
* to share my resume and contact info away from other social media
* as a sandbox to learn more about building things on the internet

This site is not a business. Since this site is openly visible to the entire
world, I don't plan to post about my personal life on this site.

## Who is it for

I don't expect many readers. But I hope the exercise of writing posts will help
me organize my work and ideas by forcing me to articulate my thoughts in
concise writeups.

However, I *am* curious to know if this site has any visitors, so the site may
include some non-instrusive tracking features to help me collect that data.[^2]
The costs associated with running the site should be low and it's not a
business or money-making venture, so I won't put ads on the site.

## What is coming next

In the next few days/weeks:

* I will post an updated resume
* I will write the first of many posts about a small project I am beginning
* I will make some tweaks to the website style to get my desired look and feel

Thanks again for visiting! If you have any comments, questions, or issues to
report with the site, please [contact me](/contact/).
Any feedback is appreciated.
